function filtered = Kuwahara(original,winsize)
%Kuwahara   filters an image using the Kuwahara filter
%   filtered = Kuwahara(original,windowSize) filters the original image with a
%                                            given windowSize and yields the result in filtered
% winsize=5;
% 
% This function is optimised using vectorialisation, convolution and
% the fact that, for every subregion
%     variance = (mean of squares) - (square of mean).
% A nested-for loop approach is still used in the final part as it is more
% readable, a commented-out, fully vectorialised version is provided as
% well.
% 
% This function is about 2.3 times faster than KuwaharaFast at
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=13474&objectType=file
% with a 5x5 window, and even faster at higher window sizes (about 4 times on a 13x13 window)
% 
% Inputs:
% original      -->    image to be filtered
% windowSize    -->    size of the Kuwahara filter window: legal values are
%                      5, 9, 13, ... = (4*k+1)
% 
% Example
% filtered = Kuwahara(original,5);
%  
% Filter description:
% The Kuwahara filter works on a window divided into 4 overlapping
% subwindows (for a 5x5 pixels example, see below). In each subwindow, the mean and
% variance are computed. The output value (located at the center of the
% window) is set to the mean of the subwindow with the smallest variance.

%    ( a  a  ab   b  b)
%    ( a  a  ab   b  b)
%    (ac ac abcd bd bd)
%    ( c  c  cd   d  d)
%    ( c  c  cd   d  d)
